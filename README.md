# MERN-Template
This template is designed for instant creation of MERN stacks.

## Steps to execute
Ensure that the **/server/config/index.js** file is correctly updated with your MongoDB connection url with username and password!

In both client and server folder you need to run the following:
```
npm install
```
In the client folder you need to run the following:
```
npm run-script build
```
In the server folder you need to run the following:
```
npm run start
```

## Development Testing of Components
In the **/client** folder you may execute the following code:
```
npm start
```
In the **/server** folder you may execute the following code:
```
npm run dev
```
The previous commands will allow you to run the client or server separately.

## Afterwards
Afterwards the project is free to be toyed with! The client is made with Node/React while the server is made with Node/Express. Enjoy!
